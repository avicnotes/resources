## C
1. [Covers C and Python - CS50 Harvard course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)
I recommend this one: its beginner friendly for C and python.

## Python

1. [Open Courseware Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

2. [Google's python course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) 

## Java
1. [Getting started with Java - Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/getting-started/java.html)
2. [Learn Java - Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)



NB: 
1. No matter which course you will take. Watch week 0 of [CS50 Harvard course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/0/). It might give you a good overview of what coding or programming is all about.

2. Syntax(the special words used) between languages will change but remember, all programing languages will always have:

- Variables, Types, Operators
- Methods, Conditionals
- Loops, Arrays
- Classes and Objects
- Functions
